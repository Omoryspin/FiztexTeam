       <h3>Global Problem</h3>
       <p>
      <!-- твой текст тут -->
      Coral reefs are currently rapidly dying out. The main reason is the increase in ocean temperatures caused by global climate change. Scientists warn that with an increase in global temperature of 1.5 ° C, humanity may lose up to 90% of all corals, and with an increase to 2 ° C — almost 99%. Already today, massive cases of coral bleaching are being recorded, a process in which they lose symbiotic algae and become vulnerable to disease and death.

In the last decade alone, humanity has lost about 14% of corals worldwide. This is a huge loss, considering that coral reefs occupy less than 1% of the ocean area, but they are home to more than 25% of all marine species. In addition, they protect coasts from storms, help purify water, and provide millions of people with food, jobs, and income from tourism.

The latest, fourth in history, global outbreak of coral bleaching began in 2023 and continues to this day. According to scientists, more than 84% of the world's coral reefs have been exposed to heat stress. This is the largest bleaching event on record, affecting reefs in all tropical oceans.

Coral loss has not only environmental, but also economic consequences. According to experts, the annual contribution of coral reefs to the global economy is estimated at 1-3 trillion dollars. Their disappearance will endanger food security, biodiversity, and the sustainability of entire coastal regions.

        <h3>How we came to the project.</h3>
        <p>The work on our project began with the stage of individual selection of topics. Each team member proposed their own idea, and after a series of presentations and discussions, it was decided to choose this particular topic — the development of a device for saving coral reefs. It has received the most support due to its relevance, innovation, and environmental focus.

After approving the concept, we started creating the first layouts. The first version of the device was made from improvised materials — styrofoam and sushi sticks. This prototype allowed us to visualize the shape of the device, think over the placement of components and demonstrate the basic principle of operation. Despite the simplicity of the design, the layout was an important step in the design process and helped the team coordinate.

The next stage was a 3D-printed model. It was made of standard plastic and reflected the shape of the future device much more accurately. We have tested the layout of the internal elements and the operation of the cooling system. This layout made it possible to identify technical nuances and refine the design.

The final version of the device was made using recycled plastic and also created on a 3D printer. This material was chosen deliberately for the purposes of sustainable production and minimal environmental impact. We have refined the shape of the housing, improved the heat sink, added compartments for electronics and placed all sensors, Peltier elements, pumps and LEDs according to their functions.

Gradually, we turned the idea into a full-fledged prototype, combining environmental principles with modern technologies. Each stage of the project's development became an important part of the overall process, from a simple mock-up to a sustainable and functional device that can contribute to the preservation of the marine ecosystem.</p>

        <h3>Our Project</h3>
        <p>
            We have developed an innovative device designed to monitor and stabilize coral reef habitats. The main objective of the project is to maintain optimal seawater parameters for the conservation and restoration of the coral ecosystem.

Inside the device, there are sensors that continuously measure the temperature, pH, and salinity of the water. All the collected data is transmitted in real-time, allowing you to monitor and respond to environmental changes.

To actively regulate the water temperature, Peltier elements based on the thermoelectric effect are placed on the sides of the housing. These elements are capable of both heating and cooling water: one side heats up, the other cools down. A heat sink is placed on the cold side, which not only removes heat, but also converts it into electricity, increasing the energy efficiency of the system.

The device is also equipped with an automatic acidity correction system. When the pH of the water changes, the built-in pumps supply the necessary solutions, ensuring a stable chemical environment favorable for coral life.

To compensate for the lack of light required for photosynthesis of symbiotic algae of corals, LEDs and a photoresistor are installed on the upper part of the hull. If the light level decreases, the system automatically activates the backlight, simulating natural sunlight.

The body of the device is made of biodegradable plastic, safe for the marine environment. In order to increase autonomy, we have provided for the installation of solar panels that are placed above the surface of the water and provide power to the system from a renewable energy source.

Our project is a sustainable, eco-friendly and technological solution capable of actively participating in the protection of coral reefs. With the help of intelligent control and autonomous regulatory systems, we create conditions in which corals can survive, grow and recover, despite the deteriorating environmental situation.
